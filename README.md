# [Gridify with Dapper in Asp.Net Core 7]

## Gridify
  # Purpose: 
  Gridify is a lightweight library designed specifically for filtering, sorting, and paginating data collections within .NET applications, especially in contexts like grids or lists.
  # How It Works: 
  Gridify applies dynamic filtering and sorting directly on IQueryable objects, which makes it ideal for handling data within the application layer, typically after data has been fetched from a database.
  # Use Case: 
  Gridify is best suited for scenarios where you need to implement dynamic data operations (like filtering and sorting) on data collections in your .NET application without having to write custom logic for each operation. It works well with LINQ and can be easily integrated with ORMs like Entity Framework or micro-ORMs like Dapper.
